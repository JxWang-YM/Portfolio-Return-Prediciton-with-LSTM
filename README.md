# Portfolio Return Prediciton with LSTM

Objective
-----------
This project is intent to be a hands-on exercise to understand the intricacy and implementation of the LSTM Neural Network. 

This project consists of two parts:
- Monthly return prediction for a portfolio of selected stocks ('AAL', 'DIS', 'F', 'MSFT') using LSTM Neural Network. 
- Using the predicted returns to construct the optimal portfolio using Efficient Fronter approach
